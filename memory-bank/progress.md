   - Status: ‚úÖ Implemented with interactive charts, heatmaps, and data tables

### Milestones
1. ‚úÖ Initial Setup
   - Memory bank documentation ‚úÖ
   - Project structure ‚úÖ
   - Development environment ‚úÖ

2. ‚úÖ Core Implementation
   - ‚úÖ Data retrieval with timezone handling
   - ‚úÖ Calculations with timezone awareness
   - ‚úÖ Basic UI with Streamlit

3. Enhanced Features
   - ‚úÖ Interactive visualizations with Plotly charts and heatmaps
   - üîú Performance optimizations

### Technical Debt
- ‚úÖ Implemented caching for stock data to reduce API calls
- ‚úÖ Added type hints to improve code maintainability
- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive logging with Streamlit integration
- Consider adding timezone configuration options for different regions

### Lessons Learned
1. Project Structure
   - Modular design with separate files for data, calculations, and UI works well
   - Clear separation of concerns makes the codebase more maintainable

2. Development Setup
   - Virtual environment ensures clean dependency management
   - Requirements.txt with version constraints helps maintain stability

3. Data Handling
   - Consistent timezone handling is crucial across all components
   - Converting dates to strings for API calls can prevent timezone issues
   - Always ensure DataFrame indices are timezone-aware when working with time series data
   - Comprehensive logging helps track data flow and debug issues
