5. Performance Optimization
   - [x] Parallel data fetching
   - [ ] Cache lookup optimization
   - [ ] Portfolio calculation optimization
   - [ ] Memory management for portfolios

### Known Issues
1. Performance
   - Cache system needs performance testing
   - Portfolio calculations may be resource-intensive with many stocks
   - Memory usage increases with portfolio size
   - Large portfolios may experience slower load times
   - Correlation matrix may be slow with many stocks

2. Fixed Issues
   - âœ… Timezone inconsistencies between data retrieval and calculations
   - âœ… Cache system timezone awareness
   - âœ… yfinance API timezone handling

3. Testing
   - Comprehensive test suite implemented
   - Test coverage for all core functionality
   - Cache system fully tested
   - Portfolio calculations verified
   - Correlation matrix tests complete

3. Implementation
   - Limited to equal-weight portfolio calculations
   - No advanced portfolio statistics
   - Cache system needs optimization for large datasets
   - âœ… Correlation analysis implemented with interactive visualization

### Evolution of Decisions
1. Architecture
   - Initial Decision: Monolithic Streamlit application
   - Rationale: Simplicity and rapid development
   - Status: Maintained

2. Data Source
   - Initial Decision: Yahoo Finance API
   - Rationale: Free access to historical data
   - Status: Implemented with error handling and data validation

3. Visualization
   - Initial Decision: Plotly + Streamlit native components
   - Rationale: Interactive charts and good integration
   - Status: âœ… Implemented with interactive charts, heatmaps, and data tables

### Milestones
1. âœ… Initial Setup
   - Memory bank documentation âœ…
   - Project structure âœ…
   - Development environment âœ…

2. âœ… Core Implementation
   - âœ… Data retrieval with timezone handling
   - âœ… Calculations with timezone awareness
   - âœ… Basic UI with Streamlit

3. Enhanced Features
   - âœ… Interactive visualizations with Plotly charts and heatmaps
   - ðŸ”œ Performance optimizations
   - âœ… Error handling with graceful fallbacks

### Technical Debt
- âœ… Implemented caching for stock data to reduce API calls
- âœ… Added type hints to improve code maintainability
- Consider adding logging for better debugging
- Consider adding timezone configuration options for different regions

### Lessons Learned
1. Project Structure
   - Modular design with separate files for data, calculations, and UI works well
   - Clear separation of concerns makes the codebase more maintainable

2. Development Setup
   - Virtual environment ensures clean dependency management
   - Requirements.txt with version constraints helps maintain stability

3. Data Handling
   - Consistent timezone handling is crucial across all components
   - Converting dates to strings for API calls can prevent timezone issues
   - Always ensure DataFrame indices are timezone-aware when working with time series data
